# EduSeminarsPK â€“ Seminar & Opportunities Platform

## Project Overview

**EduSeminarsPK** is a modern web platform built with Next.js for discovering, registering, and learning about academic seminars, scholarships, and career opportunities. It is designed for students and young professionals seeking to advance their education and careers through expert-led events, mentorship, and global networking.

### Key Features

- **Seminar Listings:** Browse upcoming and featured seminars with details on speakers, topics, schedule, and registration.
- **Opportunities Hub:** Explore scholarships, internships, mentorships, and study abroad programs.
- **Speaker & Seminar Details:** View in-depth information about each seminar, including speaker bios, session schedules, and tags.
- **Registration System:** Register for seminars and opportunities directly from the platform.
- **Contact & FAQ:** Get answers to common questions and contact the team via a built-in form (EmailJS integration).
- **Success Stories:** Read testimonials from students who have benefited from the platform.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Animated gradients, icons (Lucide), and interactive components for an engaging experience.
- **Admin-Ready Data Structure:** Seminar and opportunity data is modular and easy to extend for future backend/API integration.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (React framework for SSR and static sites)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Lucide Icons** (modern SVG icon set)
- **EmailJS** (contact form email delivery)
- **Netlify/vercel** (deployed)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

### How It Works

1. **Landing Page:** Users are greeted with a hero section, stats, and quick access to featured seminars and opportunities.
2. **Seminars Page:** Lists all upcoming seminars. Each seminar links to a detail page with full info and a registration button.
3. **Opportunities Page:** Highlights scholarships, internships, mentorships, and study abroad options.
4. **About Page:** Explains the mission, vision, impact, and team behind EduSeminarsPK.
5. **Contact Page:** FAQ and contact form for inquiries or seminar suggestions.
6. **Footer & Navbar:** Persistent navigation and quick links throughout the site.

### Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:

- Full-stack ready architecture (easy to connect to APIs or databases)
- Modern, accessible, and responsive design
- Real-world features: event management, registration, contact/FAQ, and testimonials
- Clean, modular React/Next.js codebase
- Integration with third-party services (EmailJS)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
